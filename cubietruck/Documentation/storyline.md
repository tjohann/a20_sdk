Storyline Cubietruck
====================

baalue
------

The cubietruck is used a possible node for my cluster (baalue).

Baalue is my common embedded development environment. It is a cluster with 8 worker nodes and 1 master nodes (a cubietruck). I use it for 2 different usecases:

	- distributed build via distcc (see https://github.com/tjohann/baalue_distcc.git)
	- plattform for parallel programming within distributed address space

It is also a test environment for hypervisor environments like jailhouse (https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse).

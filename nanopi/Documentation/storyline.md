Overview
--------

I join some lessons on mobile robotic (https://www.open2study.com/courses/mobile-robotics) and therefore i need a small device (in case of size) to put it on a simple chassis (http://www.sainsmart.com/robotics/sainsmart-2wd-smart-car-chassis-kit-tracing-car-with-speed-encoder-1-48-for-arduino.html).
